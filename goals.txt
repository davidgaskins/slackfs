Why even do this?
=================
I want to be able to search pins. Grepping through pins seems like fun.

Desired Functionality
=====================
channels:
- read them
- post a message
- get pins
- get files
- get info

UI Decisions
=================
channel.chat
channel.pins
channel.files
channel.info

Interactivity
=============
open chat file 	-> fetch the channel history
open pins 		-> fetch the pins
open files 		-> fetch the file names
open info 		-> fetch the info
append to chat	-> post message
